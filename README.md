This app allows users to search for venues based on their location.
Venues are presented in a collection view under the map view

or in a table view.

Selecting a collection view or a table view cell segues to a venue detail view controller.

Users can save the venue to a pre-existing collection or save it to a new collection.

In the collections tab users can see all their created collections.

Selecting on a collection cell segues to the collection's list of venues.

User's can edit their collections by removing venues.
